// This is a simple competition game where people will burn WRLD.
// After a certain amount of time has passed, the game will end with the next burn and the person who has burned the most WRLD will receive the total amount of TRX held by the contract.
// The next version will burn rather than return WRLD and it would be nice if it could restart automatically. I could even add a fund booster by requiring a small amount of TRX (10 or so) to register.

// Require registration by paying a certain number of TRX. Part of that fee goes to the pool and part goes to us.

// Convert mappings to include maps to rounds so I can restart the game.
