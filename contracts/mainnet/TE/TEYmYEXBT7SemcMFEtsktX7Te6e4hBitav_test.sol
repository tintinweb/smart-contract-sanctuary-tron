LEGAL DISCLAIMER
Participating in any cryptocurrency project is a high-risk activity including the TruQoin outlined in this
whitepaper, in particular, is aimed at experienced professionals who are used to blockchain technology,
cryptocurrency trading, and trading other market instruments such as stocks, derivatives, and forex
markets.
By participating in this TruQoin cryptocurrency project, the buyer is aware and accepts the risks related
to security, the potential lack of economic results. Finally, the buyer declares being aware of the legal
uncertainty of this type of transaction and to have conducted his own legal guidance according to the
applicable law to which he subscribes.
Any buyer purchasing TruQoin tokens acknowledges the technological and economic uncertainty of the
project presented in this white-paper. Therefore, buyers are aware of the absence of any legal action
against the TruIQ Global company in case of failure, nonperformance, or non-implementation of the
project, as well as in the case of the TruQoin tokens losing part or even the totality of its value. Purchase
of the TruQoin tokens confers the ability to use the coming TruQoin platform services.
No other rights are transferred upon the TruQoin project. Precisely, the TruIQ Global company’s only
obligation is to distribute the TruQoin tokens under the conditions defined in the white-paper.
During the TruQoin project, the TruIQ Global company may not be held liable for any of the following:
• Use of the service that is not compliant with the applicable
terms;
• An error, malfunction, malicious action, or violation of white-paper’s terms by the user, a third party or
service controlled by a third party;
• All direct or indirect damage that may occur during the
operation: cryptocurrency losses, profits or financial losses or
other damages whatsoever in the type;
• The loss of control, any reason (loss, hacking, unwanted
disclosure or technical failure), of the users’ login credentials which would lead to fraudulent use of the
tokens;
• The temporary or permanent suspension of the service, whatever
the cause, and especially due to a request from the public
authorities, judicial authority, or any third party;
• Computer failure resulting in loss of data, including content in case of impact;
• the professional activity of users;
• Lack of compatibility between the service specificity and the
customers' requirements;
• Generally, all damage whose cause does not depend on the
TruIQ Global company: Internet network outage, failure specific to the user’s equipment, etc.
Warning about the TruQoin token
According to the European regulation, the TruQoin tokens is
a cryptographic utility token usable on the TRON blockchain and allowing, in the long term, to access the
functionalities of the TruQoin platform.
The TruQoin tokens are not a security or a financial instrument within the meaning of the Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) of the European Parliament (2014/65/ EU)Monetary and
Financial Code.
Participating in a TruQoin project is a high-risk activity. This TruQoin project in particular is only aimed
at experienced professionals who are used to blockchain technology, cryptocurrency trading, and trading
other marketing instruments. By participating in this TruQoin project, the buyer is aware and accepts the
risks related to security, the potential lack of technical and economic results, and the total or partial loss
of its capital.
Finally, the buyer declares being aware of the legal uncertainty of this type of transaction and to have
conducted his own legal guidance according to the applicable law to which he subscribes. Indeed, the
token grants no financial (income, capital, or dividend) or voting rights in the TruIQ Global company.
The token is a crypto-coin issued by TruQoin Private Member Association through the TruQoin project
and used by the members of the TruQoin Private Member Association platform and
community.
Warning about Points
All Points are without any value or price and are not traded for any cryptocurrency, coin, or token that is
outlined in this white-paper. Points are not an asset and do not securitize any debt instruments,
cryptocurrency, coin, token, or anything else. Points only serve as a way to determine the amount of
mined coin to be divided from a completed mined block.
Sales Restrictions
Participation in the TruQoin project is strictly reserved for any natural man or woman that joins as a
member of the TruQoin Private Member Association, hereafter "Member", and is acting within the scope
of their professional activities.
Especially, the professional buyer claims to have a good
knowledge of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency. Any
Member acting on a nonprofessional basis as a simple consumer
within the meaning of EU Directive 2011/83/EU relating to consumer rights is excluded from the TruQoin
project. It is the responsibility of each buyer to determine its non-professional status and, in doing so, to
refrain from participating in any way in the TruQoin project. Due to national legislation, participants
from the following countries are not allowed to
participate in the TruQoin project: “US person”, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, and China. This
prohibition applies to all types of people (moral, physical, agent, etc.) and any indirect participation (via a
proxy, a name loan, etc.). By participating in the TruQoin project, the buyer agrees to the legal disclaimer
and, especially, that he respects the above
provisions community.
Warnings
TruQoin projects are high-risk operations because of their experimental nature. By participating in this
operation, participants declare to understand and assume the following risks: the lack of regulation: the
buyer agrees not to benefit from any guarantees associated with TruQoin project on regulated financial
markets or other regulated financial investments; capital loss: the buyer accepts the risk of a total or
partial capital loss in cryptocurrency or the token; volatility or market risk: the value of tokens, just like
that of cryptocurrencies in general, can be extremely volatile and subject to significant, and largely
unforeseeable fluctuations. Moreover, the market or markets on which these tokens are traded do not
offer the same guarantees that are generally applicable to conventional financial markets.
Very early project stage
Although the TruQoin project will generate trades of other cryptocurrencies and send mine coins to the
Members, there are no aims to finance or raise monies. This innovative project is based on a new concept
of Activity Mining and the Proof-of-Activity mining model, and whose future evolutions are
unpredictable. Therefore, the buyer accepts the risk of non-fulfillment of the project for technical,
economic, or legal reasons.
TRON Protocol: the token is developed on the TRON protocol
which is still at an experimental stage. Therefore, the buyer
understands and accepts the risk that an evolution of the protocol renders the token or service unusable.
Security risk: the buyer understands and accepts the risk of losing the Member's total value due to a
security breach. If the TruIQ Global TruIQ Global company makes every effort to ensure the TruQoin
project safety, the experimental nature of the operation does not exclude the realization of financial or IT
damages.
It is recommended that the buyer takes all measures to ensure the safety of his tokens and
cryptocurrencies. Legal risk: The TruQoin project has been structured to comply with the current
regulations and good practices applicable. Nevertheless, the governing law of the TruQoin project is
under construction around the world. The TruIQ Global company cannot be held liable in cases where
restrictive regulations, injunctions by regulators, investigation, or laws having an impact, in particular, on
the issue, management, or possession of token were to be adopted. Also, the rules applicable to
cryptocurrencies or tokens are different in each country. This is why buyers are strongly advised to do a
legal and tax analysis before they participate in the TruQoin project.
Risk of theft and piracy: The TruIQ Global company cannot be held responsible for acts of hacking (in
infiltration, defacement, or DDoS) or computer theft that would affect the funds, the distribution of
tokens, or the smooth roll of the TruQoin project.
Risk of an error or weakness: The TruIQ Global company cannot be held responsible for discovering a
weakness in the cryptographic processes implemented in the context of the TruQoin project.
Similarly, the buyer declares to accept and understand the risk of an error in the code of the smartcontract,
the trust account (multi-sig wallet), or the software used for the TruQoin project. However, see
the last Decision of G20 in this matter and FATF Guideline Full information on the legal terms relating to
the TruQoin project is available at the following website: https://www.XXXXXXXXX.zzz
TruQoin White Paper
We are fully integrating the TruQoin cryptocurrency and the TruIQ business in a way
that links those activities that are good for a business and increases the business value
to the coin distribution mining model we call “Activity Mining”, and these Good
Activities will result in increased market exchange value.
Tru IQ Global is a growing health products business that has existing sales that decided to use
blockchain technology to enhance the business performance by rewarding people that are active in
building the value in the business. This includes the business staff, customers, distributors, retailers, or
anyone that does anything to create what the business deems as positive to the growth of the business.
These “Good Activities” will translate into the positive effect of the TruQoin on the cryptocurrency
exchange markets and are unique in how the blockchain technology has been used.
Not an Initial Coin Offering "ICO"
Tru IQ is not a start up and this crypto currency project is not created as a way to raise funds in an
Initial Coin Offering “ICO”. Although an ICO is effective in raising money to launch their business
start-ups, these startups saw coins/tokens as just a way to represent the value of the business, just as
the stock would represent the value of the company.
Not Coins as Shares
The Initial Coin Offering "ICO" as a way to launch a company and raise money for that company.
Where each coin would represent a share of the profits or a percentage of goods and services and is
somewhat akin to holding stock in a company. This is a valid way to raise funds for a startup but the
use of ICO's has now slowed since the similarity with Initial Stock Offering "ISO" has placed it in the
headlights of the Securities and Exchange Commission "SEC" for regulation.
Unique Niches - Activity Mining
TruQoin is not raising money in a ICO and it is not issuing Coins as shares. TruQoin is rewarding
those that help the business in a unique crypto model called Activity Mining. TruQoin's Activity
Mining model is about adding value to the business by using the most successful crypto currency
mining model. The Bitcoin mining model will be closely followed, and at the same time we leverage
other blockchain innovations and architectures for our new approach that fill a unique niche.
What Make Bitcoin And Other Coins Unique
The Bitcoin mining model created value from its proof-of-work concept, that says there is value in the
activities in making Bitcoin that translated to increased value on the crypto mart exchanges. TruQoin
uses proof-of-activity in making TruQoin that translated to increased value on the crypto mart
exchanges.
We have seen many coins go on crypto exchanges and hope to do what Bitcoin has done and create
value through acceptance. Bitcoin has achieved this acceptance primarily because Bitcoin was first to
market and is fast approaching a Trillion dollar market cap.
Bitcoin has led the way in being unique out of thousands of other coins on the exchanges, the top 100
coins have achieved acceptance for being first in what makes those coins unique. Ethereum is an
open-source project that was first to add smart contracts; that unique innovation has consistently placed
Ethereum as number two spot on crypto market exchanges. Another Coin in the top 25 coins is Tron, It
is a clone of Ethereum, and made its mark in the marketplace with an improved consensus algorithm
that allows it to process hundreds of times faster than Ethereum. This faster speed allows Tron to
process today, 30% more transactions every day than Ethereum, and it can do much more. This speed
innovation will push Tron into the top 10 spots on the exchanges as Ethereum has tapped out its
bandwidth processing 600K transactions per day.
Tron also demonstrates that a clone of another coin (Ethereum) can also have something that makes it
unique. Tron changed the consensus algorithm that made it many times faster. This made it unique
enough to the world to allow it a place in the top 100. The question is; if the change in the consensus
algorithm was only a few percent faster than Ethereum, would it hold a spot in the top 100 coins? That
is for the market to decide, but I think that it would not. Being hundreds of times faster becomes much
more likely to take up the #2 spot as Ethereum hits the transaction barrier and cant do more
transactions. All of the top crypto exchange coins are there because they are unique and fill a need.
There are many coins do not hold value on these exchanges. We find that most of these coins did not
live up to the hype their marketing team had projected. These coins only gain some limited acceptance
through their marketing campaign. When they do not appear to fill the niche as advertised, the people
stop believing in the coin, then the marketing ends, so does the value of the coin.
The marketing ends due to the lack of any substance behind the coin. The marketing cry of those that
say "look what happened to bitcoin" loses meaning when the new coin does not act like Bitcoin in any
way. The days of marketing-based coins are over. A new coin needs to fill a need and demonstrates the
coins have a substance that can be valued.
It all About Creating Coin Value
The demand will grow for coins that demonstrate value in their Utility, Scarcity, and Perceived Value.
Reference : https://masterthecrypto.com/guide-how-to-value-a-cryptocurrency/
Utility
A coin must have a strong function (or use-case) to incentivize people to hold the coins; a coin’s utility
is strongly correlated with its value.
Scarcity
Scarcity refers to the finite nature of the coins. In economics, a fixed supply of a certain item would
increase its value in the long term, assuming its demand increases. This creates scarcity, as there is only
a limited supply of coins in circulation.
Perceived Value
A coin is only as valuable as what the markets deem it to have. The market perceives the value of a
coin depends on factors that are core to the development of the unique project that fills a need.
Therefore, projects that persistently achieve their milestones that were set out in their whitepaper will
gain Perceived Value.
Backed Value- Security Token Offering "STO"
The crypto industry has evolved to create a clear way to raise money to launch a company that does act
as a Security and will be regulated as a stock-based company is regulated. The Security Token
Offering "STO" is a process similar to an ICO where an investor exchanges fiat money (Securitized
Debt Instruments) for coins or tokens representing their investment. The distributed tokens fall under
the status of securities as they are linked to an underlying investment asset such as stocks, bonds, real
estate investment trusts (REIT), or other Securitized Debt Instruments.
These Coin offerings are valid ways to raise money, but they do not come close to tapping the vast
possibilities the blockchain technologies have to offer. When properly applied, these technologies can
be fully integrated into the business functions and be used to propel the business value and the coin
value symbiotically.
Stable Coins Value
Value is shown in Stable coins as they are backed by some stored assets, fiat currency, or something
else that is valued by the world. Many US dollar-based stable coins have entered the market exchanges
and the Utility is in the use as safe heaven when a crypto trader wants to jump out of a coin he feels is
about to drop in price. Only to trade the US Stable coin back for a coin the trader thinks is going up.
Scarcity is from its limited value behind the coin. Their Perceived Value of the Stablecoin comes from
the perceived value of "what thing of value" in backing the coin.
These Stable Coins fill a need and can demonstrate value, but their connection to fiat US dollars also
makes them a Securitized Debt Instrument and no doubt at some point will have capital gains
consequences and more regulations to deal with.
Algorithmic Stablecoin
Algorithmic Stablecoins are new to the crypto markets. Stablecoins are a cryptocurrency that achieves
market price stability by algorithmically expanding and contracting the coin's circulating supply in
response to market behavior.
If the price of the Stablecoin begins falling beneath its pegged price, then the algorithm will reduce the
supply of coins in circulation, resulting in the increased demand. If the price of the Stablecoin climbs
above its pegged amount, the algorithm will release more coins into circulation to devalue the coin.
This is based on the Quantity Theory of Money, which says the general price level of goods and
services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation. This means if you were to
double the money supply in circulation, then the cost of goods would double overtime. The reverse is
true, by reducing the money supply in circulation, the cost of goods would decrease proportionally.
Now that we understand the basics of how an algorithm can be used to peg the price of the coin and
adjust the money supply, but this does not offer any reward for the consensus of the price nor any
independent value of the coin on the market, just the pegged value. It does show that algorithms to
affect the price are being used were just a few years ago this was tabu.
Proof of Members (PoM)
The PoM model uses an algorithm to derive a value based on the number of members that have agreed
to participate in the use of the coin. The core principle is that the more people you have using your
coin the more value the coin has. The Reward Value Model is not from the work of mining, it is from
the work of growing the number of coin users. The people receive an allotment of coins for the work of
joining, using, and adding more people to the community, as their reward.
The activity of the members is in this case is important, if very few members are active in the use of the
coin, then the value is also smaller than a coin where all the members are using the coin.
Transaction Activity Value
The economic theory called the Currencies Fair Value Model that says in general terms, that the more
transactions that occur for any coin, that this activity can represent more value. If not direct repression
of value, but over time this trend will affect the value. The more activity of transactions the greater
increase in the value of the coin. I will expand the use of the Currencies Fair Value Model to count the
activity of the Business as well as the activities on the market exchange in this analysis to show that the
“More Transactions Equates to More Value”.
The following analysis covers the reasoning as to why the Value of a Coin increases the more
Transactions. Links for Analysis and Source Data for Quantity Theory of Money* “QTM”, and the
Currencies Fair Value Model “CFV”** and Total Discounted Supply Theory of Money are at the
bottom of this page.
What the QTM tries to model is the human action of trading money for goods and services. In its
average version, QTM proposes the following:
M⋅V =P⋅T
Where M stands for the money in circulation, V (“velocity of money”) stands for the average number
of times a unit of money is traded per unit of time. P stands for the average price of the good or service
in each transaction. And T stands for the number of transactions per unit of time (including only the
transactions where a good or service was traded). Sometimes this model is used to try to find out what
the value of the velocity of money is. Other times it is used to try to convince others that if the
monetary authority increases M, P – the average price of the goods and services – shall increase. Of
course, providing that V and T do not change.
The modification of QTM introduced by TDSTM is to consider M as the sum of the current supply plus
the discounted future supply. It can be expressed as:
Where M0 stands for the current supply in circulation, i stands for the interest rate, t stands for the time,
t0 stands for the current time, ΔMk stands for the future increase of the supply at instant k, and m(t)
stands for the velocity of the supply increase. From now on, I will call M the total discounted supply.
P ≃ TTA·MB AB TTB MA
“... There are important consequences of the Currencies Fair Value model. The value of a currency is
directly proportional to the number of trades that are taking place per unit of time.” **
Reward Value Models - Consensus vs Algorithm - PoW PoS vs PoM PoA
Consensus-Based Value
Proof of Work and Proof of Stack are both used to solve the double-spend problem that is inherent in
electronic money. This solution is a reward for those involved in creating the value of the coin from a
process called mining.
Proof of Work (PoW)
Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW) shows the value of the coin is tied to energy, time, and computing
power to create Bitcoin value. The PoW algorithm used in solving math puzzles to validate transactions
and keeps the ledger of those transactions returns bitcoin as the reward is called mining. The reward
for solving the puzzles that create a Mined Block is the Bitcoin "Coin" itself.
Bitcoin Perceived Value From PoW Mining Model
Bitcoin Mining Model (Proof of Work) is what made Bitcoin unique and showed that could prove that
energy, time, equipment, was used to create the Bitcoin. This is referred to as Proof of Work "PoW".
The Utility, Scarcity, and Perceived Value, in Bitcoin Mining, has created the value.
Bitcoins Utility
The mining reward is in Bitcoin. It pays the miners for the validation of transactions and maintaining
the blockchain.
Bitcoin Scarcity
The total supply is limited to 21 million coins, and the supply of new coins that are added from mining
each day is cut by 50% every 210,000 mined blocks (about every 4 years). This reduced amount of coin
released adds to the scarcity.
Bitcoin Perceived Value
It was the first to market. When the first exchanges came into existence, they provided a place where
people could turn Bitcoin into cash that they could spend. This perception of being able to convert at
will to fiat money, "Cask Out" gave confidence to the Bitcoin user. There is also a perception that the
Bitcoin Mining Model also added to the value because it was secure and private.
Proof of Stake (PoS)
A proof-of-stake system functions as a cryptographic proof of ownership and proof of vested interest in
the project’s ongoing success. To participate in maintaining the network, nodes “lock-up” native tokens
using a smart contract, rendering them un-spendable for the allocated time. To extend the consensus
history on the blockchain, a deterministic algorithm randomly selects which nodes become validators
for each new block. This randomized selection process, as well as stakeholders’ vested interest (stored
value) in the network, is intended to disincentivize participants from attempting to sabotage history and
choosing to undermine the system. The cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is a high-profile example of a
project that is currently in the process of migrating away from proof-of-work "PoW" toward proof-ofstake
"PoS".
The PoW and PoS are both types of consensus mechanisms that are designed to solve the issue of trust
between the participants of a blockchain network with a reward in coin from the activity of mining. We
do not concern ourselves in the debate over which is better, because we are not building a blockchain
network.
Activity Reward Value Models
We are going to use an existing blockchain network to host our coin. The Tron blockchain is a clone of
Ethereum and has a much faster consensus algorithm. This means we are not going to base our rewards
to our participants on maintaining the trust conditions of a running consensus algorithm. We are going
to base the reward on value creation activities for a business. In our new proof-of-activities, the "PoA"
model will "Value Activities", and provide rewards are from the mining power generated from those
activities that are valued by the business.
Symbiotic Business Coin Integration
Our integration of the coin into the operation of the business will create a symbiotic relationship
between the value of the coin on the crypto market exchange and the value of the entire business.
What is good for the business is good for the coin.
What is good for the coin is good for the business.
This integration will be achieved by the use of algorithms that reflect "what is good for the business".

True Value - TruQoin
The new coin must meet the challenge of creating "True Value" for the holders of the coin, as such we
name this coin "TruQoin". TruQoin will have Utility, Scarcity, and Perceived Value; through our
unique coin model we call Proof of Activity (PoA).
Proof-of-Activity Model (PoA)
We want TruQoin to add value to existing business activities that create product sales.
What we want is not a coin that represents the worth of the business, instead, we are going to connect
the TruQoin value to the activity of the business that creates value. There many different activities that
create value for a business and the same can be said for the value of a coin. However, our model will
look at what activities are creating transactions for a business as measured by sales volume and what
activities are creating transactions for a business as measured by sales volume on the exchanges. There
are two "2" activities that we will tie together to create value for both the business and the coin; we will
use a unique mining model that mimics the Bitcoin mining model.
Activity Value
Consider a business that has zero workers and zero sales and zero assets. We can say the business has
zero value. If the workers are working and creating assets and sales, we can say the business has value.
Every business is different and those activities that create value to each business will be unique. Some
may think that the total volume of sales or the number of transactions would be universal as the
activity, but this not necessarily the case. A business can have a million transactions a day and still not
stay in business. We have to look at what activity is valued and what activities are not valued.
Business Activity Equals Coin Value
The TruQoin PoA model will demonstrate that by tying the Business Activity that creates value in the
business to TruQoin's utility, scarcity, and perceived value; that the value will be reflected in the
market value as the "Price" of the coin.
Activity Utility Value
The active use of TruQoin for payment shows value. When there is a transaction of real physical
goods, digital goods, and services are exchanged for TruQoin, the utility becomes obvious.
Activity Scarcity Value
The more scarcity in the supply of coins the more value.
We achieve scarcity in two ways.
First, by capping the total supply to 21,000,000 total fungible coin units. This coin supply reflects the
total number of coin units that are on the bitcoin blockchain.
Second, by mining TruQoins in a model inspired by the success of Bitcoin mining. We will use the
same basic formula for the release of coins after a Block is mined. The only difference is the Bitcoin
completes a Block through the PoW completion of solving the math problem and TruQoin is using the
number of transactions on the blockchain to complete the mining of the block.
Bitcoin TruQoin
Coin Supply 21,000,000 21,000,000
Transactions per Block Approx. 2,020 Exact 2,100
Blocks per Halfing 210,000 100
Transactions per Halfing ~424,200,000 Exact 210,000
Coins released /Block
Start 50 50
Halfing 1st 25 25
2nd 12.5 12.5
3rd 6.25 6.25
...
... 50% of the last down to 36 halvings
The Remainder after 36 Halving and 10,000 Blocks will be placed on auction by the mine.
Points System
Points will be given to the Independent Mining Partners (IMP) for their business activity that creates
value. That is measured by points and mimics a bitcoin-like mining system. To join our Activity
Mining is done by joining our Private Member Association and generating activities they provide
points.
Activity Perceived Value
In general the Activities that are seen as valuable by an observer add to the perceived value of a coin.
The more activities that create value for the business, the more value for the coin. This will not be
direct repression of value, but over time the trends will reflect the overall business value and thus be
reflected on the market price of the coin. The greater the number of activities the greater the value to
the business value.
We will equate the principle that more transactions equal more coin value "P" to our new model that
states the all business activities "A" that create value for a business will be reflected in the value of the
coin.
More Business Activity Equates to More Value
Total Activity "A" = A1 + A2 + A3 ...
In the Quantity Theory of Money*, (Reference link on page 6)
M⋅V = P⋅T Then M⋅V = P⋅A
Since T stands for the number of transactions per unit of time
We will assume the A = T
Value in a new coin can be determined by the people's perceived value from more business activity in
the form of Transaction "Activity".
=====
TruQoin
Proof of Activity (PoA)
PoA Model uses algorithms that function to reflect the business activities to the TruQoin value on the
market exchanges. These activities are unique to the business. The Value Reward for these Activities
will be represented by the release of coins through the mining of a certain activity.
Mining
This is not the typical crypto mining that is crunching numbers, and expending energy to show work
and reap the reward of the coin, but instead the work of the members doing activities that increase the
value of the business and reap the reward in coin.
Coin Supply
The coin supply and mining model will be woven into the goals and activities that make the business
valuable.
Transactions of Burgers = Value of Activity
We can use an example of Activity where a big business uses the Activity of serving Bugers as a
representation of value.
*** McDonalds measured its success in achieving 100 million burgers in 1958 served and 1 billion in
1963, then the counter started adding billions a year until 99 Billion served in 1993. Then they stopped
counting and changed it to "Billions and Billions Served" (Emphasis on the word “Served” ).
McDonald's used the number of Transactions of burgers to show the value of the activity of "serving"
burgers. In other words, "served" is the activity that shows value.
Goal 1 Billion Transactions
We will use the short-term goal of 5,460,000 total Transactions to complete the mining of TruiCoin's
total supply of 21 million coins, and the long-term goal of One Billion Transactions of TruQoins on the
blockchain to represent the integration of TruQoin into the world economy.
Mirrored Value
TruQoin aims to have its market value reflect the value of the business activity. TruQoin value will be
a reflection of all the activity and mirror the value of the business activity by the creation of coins.
The value of the coins on the market creates links to sales of physical products and the exchange of
coins on a crypto market exchange.
The goal of TruQoin is to create a cryptocurrency that uses the growth of the company's product sales
as a measure of its value and is reflected the market exchanges.
This is a system modeled after the mining of Bitcoin crypto mining, but has little to do with the
blockchain mining in the creation of coin. Instead a trigger mechanism determined by the activity of
purchasing products is a way to determine when the coin is discovered.
Technically these coins are not mined but minted as needed based upon the algorithm that counts the
number of transaction, which represent activity of the business. Each member will has points to
awarded for their activity.
As with Bitcoin, the TruQoin Mining returns coins as a reward for the work done to create value.
All 100% of TruQoin is mined by the PoA Mining system. The total mined per Block with being split
between the Independent Mining Partners "Miners" and the TruQoin Mine "Mine". Where the Miners
are to the Business Product Sales as the Mine is to the Coin Sales on the Market Exchange.
Miners range from 50% to 90% of all coins mined from Points gathered from Product Sales Activities.
Mine range from 10% up to 50% of all coin mined from balance left from the Miners.
When there are more transactions (Greater Value) happens on ether the Miner of the Exchange Side,
the PoA algorithms creates an Factor A that moves mined coins from the miner side to the exchange
side and back again. The market to enhance the value of the coin and put pressure on the price to rise.
TruQoin Halving verses Bitcoin Halving
Since TruQoin is mirroring Bitcoin system including the Halving we are going analyze both.
Bitcoin Halving (From Investopia.com) https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769
After every 210,000 blocks mined, or roughly every four years, the block reward given to Bitcoin miners for
processing transactions is cut in half. This cuts in half the rate at which new Bitcoin is released into circulation.
This is Bitcoin's way of using a synthetic form of inflation that halves every four years until all Bitcoin is
released and is in circulation.﻿
This system will continue until around the year 2140. At that point, miners will be rewarded with fees for
processing transactions that network users will pay. These fees ensure that miners still have the incentive to
mine and keep the network going. The idea is that competition for these fees will cause them to remain low after
halvings are finished.
The halving is significant because it marks another drop in Bitcoin's dwindling finite supply. The total maximum
supply of Bitcoin is 21 million. At the time of writing, there are 18,361,438 Bitcoins already in circulation,
leaving just 2,638,562 left to be released via mining rewards.
In 2009, the reward for each block in the chain mined was 50 Bitcoins. After the first halving it was 25, then
12.5, and it became 6.25 Bitcoins per block as of May 11th, 2020.3﻿To put this in another context, imagine if the
amount of gold mined out of the earth was cut In half every four years. If gold's value is based on its scarcity,
then a "halving" of gold output every four years would theoretically drive its price higher.

First Block
The 1st Block will complete on the first day due to previous Product Sales Activities of $313,291.44
and 2100 transactions that completed on (2020-09-16 10:00:42.420), from the activities of the TruIQ
Global team efforts to build the business. The continued activity will be counted towards the Second
Block. This results in 105,000 being dispersed, The Miners and the Mine will each receive 50% each
(50,250 TRQ).
Starting Numbers
Since there was no previous numbers to calculate the dispersement of coins by determining the
A Factor, we will start with an even split (50%/50%) as a starting point. This First Block will
provide the seed numbers used to calculate the Second Blocks A Factor and be used on the
Swing Range Table.
Miners Side 50,250 TRQ
These first coins are a bonus to those that helped build TruIQ Global and will be sent to the
Miners wallet, but these coin will be locked in the wallet on a one year timer, to allow for the
market to develop.
Mine Side 50,250 TRQ
The other 50% will be made available by the Mine. These coin will also be held in the Miners
wallet on a one year timer to allow for the market to develop.
Second Block
The 2nd Block will be approximately 50% complete on the first day due to previous Product Sales
Activities from 2020-09-16 10:00:43.790 To 2021-03-10 10:00:56.370 and as of this date a total
Transactions (1091) product sales volume $148,278.60, resulting in 105,000 being dispersed between
the Miners and the Mine. The percentage each will receive depends on the A Factor that determines
the swing from Block to Block (see A Factor).
Next Blocks
From the 3rd Block and for each Block thereafter, we will continue to using the volume numbers from
the Product Sales and the Coin Sales to calculate the amount of coin dispersement by calculating the A
Factor and and use the Block Split Range Table.
First 100 Blocks
FIRST 100 BLOCKS (Before any Halfing Event)
50 Coins per Transaction
50 x 2,100 = 105,000 Coins per Block
105,000 x 100 = 10,500,000 in 1st 100 Blocks
SECOND 100 BLOCKS (After 1st Halfing)
25 Coins per Transaction
25 x 2,100 = 52,500 Coins per Block
52,000 x 100 = 5,250,000 in 2nd 100 Blocks
Market Analysis
In comparing TruQoin value, we can look at the what was the total volume of sales for each completed
Mined Block. If the Value increases Block to Block, then the number of Sales of the Business products
would reflect more value to the business.
This is demonstrated by the market making of TruQoin from the Exchanges. If there is a larger sales
volume then there is more to buy the coin from the Market.
Block Power Number
We can chart the Coin Value from one Block to the next by dividing the Sales Volume by the number
of coins in that block. This volume per coin number will be reflective of the value of the business
activity that is used to Mine the coin as the Power of the Block and directly reflects how well the
business is doing from one Block to the next.
If at the time the 100th Block is complete, the Mining Halfing will happen on the Next Block and the
Block Power Number will double between the two blocks if the volume is the same. The Scarcity of
coins will add to the value.

P = V/C
Block Power is equal to volume divide by coins.
Mining Points to Mine Block
Points have no value. They are used to determine a percentage of coins captured in a Mining Block.
The more points you have the more TruQoin you can mine at the completion of each Block. The coin
is released when the Miners complete a Block and the Total Points given to Miners will be divided by
the total coin release in the Block.
Formula Share of Coin Per Point
S = C/P
Activities that are Good for Business
The purpose of the PoA system of mining coin is to link the "activities that are good for business" with
the release of coin and the increase in the value of that coin.
This system is balanced between Product Sales Transactions and Crypto Exchange Transactions. The
"Good Activity" is rewarded by coin. The goal is to increase the sales volume and reward that activity.
This sales volume will happen in two arenas, the Sales of Business Products and the Sales of the coin
on the exchanges.
Activities that are Bad for Business
What is not good for the business is if either the Business Sales or the Coin Sales Exchange
Transactions are out of balance.
Points Example
Total Coin Released 105,000
Split Miner / Mine 50%/50%
Coin for Miner 52,500
Total Points given to Miners 235,100
John's points 100
Bill's points 10,500
David's points 50,000
Susan's points 174,500
Share Formula S = C/P
Point = P 235,100
Coin = C 52,500
Share = S 52,500 / 235,000 0.223309
Coin Calculations
John 100 x 0.223309 22.330923
Bill 10,500 x 0.223309 2,344.746916
David 50,000 x 0.223309 11,165.461506
Susan 174,500 x 0.223309 38,967.460655
Total 52,500
The volume of Business Sales could decrease and the Exchange Transactions could increase, and
considering that the same number of coins is released upon completion of a Block at 2100 transactions.
If only 1 Transaction was for a Business Sale, and 2099 Transactions were from the crypto exchange
sales, then the volume of Sales would be small. This condition is not good for the business.
The reverse is also not good desirable for the business. If the Volume of Sales Transactions are 100%
(2100) of the completed transactions on the blockchain, and zero Transactions were from the Crypto
Exchanges, then there would be no way to support the price of the coin on the exchange. Making it
hard to trade out the coin for other coins, "Cash Out".
Difficulty Factor
Bitcoin has a similar problem that would distort the release of Bitcoin and affect the value. Bitcoin's
solution was to add to their mining formula a "Difficulty Factor" to adjust the mining rate a block is
released. The bitcoin whitepaper explains:
"To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the
proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per
hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases."
Our PoA model is not as concerned as to the rate at which a Block is completed (2100 Transactions) as
the Bitcoin PoW model does. The PoA model concern is the sales volume changes from one block to
the next. We want the blocks to complete a fast as possible as a reflection of sales volume. The Sales
Volume Ratio is between business product sales and coin sales, and we want there to be a balance that
creates more coin value.
The balance we are concerned with is not about a 50/50 number of transactions between the Product
Sales vs Coin Sales "Exchange Transactions". The balance that creates the most value in the coin may
be 25/75, 30/70, 65/35, or any ratio that promotes the most value of the coin.
What we want to do is tether the natural increase in sales "volume" ether on the Product Sales side or
the Exchange Sales side with the increase in coins to that particular side, and shift the disbursement of
coin 5% from block to block, between the Miners and the Mine according to the Activity Factor.
PoA Activity Factor "A Factor"
The difference in volume between both the Sales of Products and Sales of Coin from one block to the
next will increase or decrease naturally. The Activity Factor "A" will be used to adjust or weight the
distribution ratio of the coin between those that are Mining the coin through their Activity of product
sales, and those that want to receive/buy the coin through the market exchanges.
Block Split
The first Block will start at a 50% / 50% split between the Miners and the Mine. After each block is
completed Activity Factor will be calculated to determine the direction of the 5% swing in coin
distribution. These swings do not override the 50% minimum for the Miner side or 10% minimum for
the Mine side.
Block Split Table

25% 75%
30% 70%
35% 65%
40% 60%
45% 55%
50% 50%
Favor the Miners
The Block Split Table favors the miners with a minimum allocation of 50% of all coin Mined up to
90%. This is because what is best for the Business and the Coin Value, is if the Miners tare engaged
the Market Exchange to sell their coin and develop the market. As Such our formulas outlined here are
designed to affect the distribution of the mined coin by 5% per Mined Block, by adding or subtracting
to the Miners side.
A Factor
The Block Split Table shows the range from Block to Block that the split between the Miners and the
Exchange distribution of coins mined, that will change depending on the A Factor.
How to determine the Activity Factor we will need:
1) P%Δ
The “Percent Change” in sales volume from Block to Block, for the
Business “Product Sales”
2) C%Δ
The “Percent Change” in sales volume from Block to Block, for the
Market Exchange “Coin Sales”
3) B%Δ
The “Percent Difference” in the ratio from Block to Block, for the
“Percent Change in Product Sales” (P%Δ) and “Percent Change in Coin Sales” (C%Δ)
4) XΔ
“Difference” between the two ratios “Business Sales” and the “Coin Sales” will
determine what direction the 5% change will go. The larger of the 2 numbers sets the
swing direction.
We will need to determine for both sides the Percent Change using a Relative Change Formula.
Percent Change = ((B - A ) / A) x 100
Note: We need only the decimal number for our calculations for “Percent Change” so we not multiple by 100,
and drop the "x 100" from all the following formulas.
%Δ = (B - A ) / A
We will also need the volume from both sides and from Block to Block.
P%Δ = Business Product Side Percent Change
Product Percent Change (W%Δ) of the volume of Product Sales from the previous Block to the current
Block.
Block-A "Pervious Block" Product Volume = ProductA
Block-B "Pervious Block" Product Volume = ProductB
Solve for Percent Difference "W" of the ratio between
The volume of Product Sales for the Previous Block to Current Block.
P%Δ = (ProductB - ProductA ) / ProductA
C%Δ = Market Exchange Side Percent Change
Coin Percent Change (C%Δ) of the volume of Coin Sales from the previous Block to the current Block.
Block-A "Pervious Block" Coin Volume = CoinA
Block-B "Pervious Block" Coin Volume = CoinB
Solve for Percent Difference "M" of the ratio between
The volume of Coin Sales for the Previous Block to Current Block.
C%Δ = (CoinB - CoinA ) / CoinA
B%Δ = Block Percent Difference
Block Percent Change of Volumes between the Product and Coin from the previous Block to the
current Block.. (P%Δ) and (C%Δ) for this current Block.
Percent Difference Formula
(%D)= ( |n1−n2| / (n1+n2 / 2) ) × 100
Note: We need only the decimal number for our calculations for “Percent Difference” so we not
multiple by 100, and drop the "x 100" from all the following formulas.
Block Percent Difference Formula
B%Δ = (P%Δ - C%Δ ) / C%Δ
The B%Δ shows the ratio between the Product and Coin volumes of the previous Block to the current
Block. This number will range from 0.00 to 2.00 and will be used to balance the direction of the coin
allocation.
XΔ = Bigger Change
The ratio Difference between the (P%Δ) and (C%Δ) will yield positive or negative value. This value
determines the trend towards the Sales of Products verse Sales of Coin.
P%Δ - C%Δ = XΔ or -XΔ
AΔ = A Factor
Now we have all the data to solve for the A Factor. The Change (AΔ) of the volumes ratios between the
Product Sales and the Coin Sales of the previous Block to the current Block now sets the 5% swing in
coin allocation for this completed mining Block..
AΔ =(B%Δ x XΔ)/|XΔ|
Example
1.618 x 1/|1| = 1.618 = A%Δ
1.618 x -1/|-1| = -1.618 = A%Δ
Block Split Range Table
Once we have the A Factor 'AΔ' we can determine the
adjustment from Block to Block between the Miner and the
Exchange. We are also using the Fibonacci Golden Ratio
(1.618) and its inverse (0.618) as an adjustment for ratio
change that a larger in one direction that is outside the
change found in nature.
Why Fibonacci Golden Ratio?
The difference between one square to the next is the Gold Ratio 161.8% and keeps this ratio to infinity.
This patten is what happens naturally and can be seen all around us.
Math is the Language of Nature.
There are many ways science is looking into nature and explaining in mathematics. Patterns can be
seen in math equations that also appear in plants, people, and things that people build.

Used to show the Natural Trends on the Market Exchange.
The Fibonacci sequence is used analyzing cryptocurrencies market exchanges trends and are useful for
estimating areas of support and resistance. Many people use combinations of Fibonacci studies to
obtain a more accurate forecast, such as Fibonacci retracements, arcs and fans. These tools help
traders draw support lines, identify resistance levels, place stop-loss orders, and set target prices. A
Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a stock chart and dividing the vertical
distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%.
Fibonacci's Golden Ratio
Golden Ratio (1.618 = 161.8%) and its inverse (0.618 = 61.8%) are used as an adjustment point of coin
dispersement. When a Sales Channel has larger growth in one direction, it is nature that dictates that
more coin should flow into that channel, but if that growth is larger or Smaller then the Golden Ratio
then the flow would reverse. This will create a syntonization between the two channels where one side
feeds the other as to support the growth naturally. In other words if the growth is outside the change
found in nature, the A A Factor will balance the two sides.
The difference from one Fibonacci ratio to the next sequence is the Gold Ratio (1.618) and is at the
core of all natural patterns. We are using the golden ratio to keep the flow of the mined coin
oscillating between two separate Sales patterns. These two patterns are interconnected and are
represented by the A Factor, and is used to adjust the swing of coin from block to block and initially
towards the channel the is experiencing a larger growth, but if that growth is larger or smaller then the
161.8% or 0.618%, the coin will flow towards the other sales channel. This will in fact support the
increasing value by sending coin to the channel that may in fact have a shortage as it was feeding the
other side.

These two charts are the results from the Activity Factor Table. The first Chart is the Coin allocation
where the Miners receive all mined coin from below the blue line. The amount oscillates from a low of
50% to a high of 90%.
The Red Line of this next chart represents the Mined coin as the blue line in the above chart. The
figures were divided by 100 so the comparison would be easier. Following the A Factor shows through
the high peaks and valleys the Red line more stable and still Mined Coin followed along the same path
but with less volatility.

Exchange On-Boarding Program
The questions are often asked, “What is the price of TRQ” or “What will TRQ sell for when it hits the
exchange?”, the answer is the same for any coin on the market; “The price someone is willing to pay for it!”
We let your purchases set the market price, so it is all up to you!
We will use our “Exchange On-Boarding Program” to determine what the starting price TRQ will start trading at
on the exchange, by letting the Miners determine that market price through their purchases of TRQ. The price of
each successive set of 100 TRQ which will increase after each Transaction.
• All transactions will be in exchange for Bitcoin.
• Starting price is 0.000001 Bitcoin - Also know as a 1 micro-Bitcoin (μBTC) or 100 Satoshi.
• Sold by 100 TRQ at a time
• After each sale of 100 TRQ the price will increase 0.000001.
• This will continue until:
◦ 525 sales of 100 TRQ = 52,500 TRQ have been completed with a final price of 0.000525 BTC is
reached.
◦ The Exchange is launched and the last sale of 100 TRQ sets the starting price of TRQ on the new
exchange.
• The Exchange On-Boarding Program ends when the Exchange Launches
• Any Remaining TRQ not sold during the on boarding process will be placed on the exchange for sale at
the last price from the Exchange On-Boarding Program.
